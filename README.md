# Company Internal Chatbot with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Project Statement  

The goal of this project is to build a secure internal chatbot system that processes natural 
language queries and retrieves department-specific company information using Retrieval-
Augmented Generation (RAG). The system will authenticate users, assign roles (Finance, 
Marketing, HR, Engineering, C-Level, Employees), and provide role-based access to company 
documents stored in a vector database. Users will input queries and receive context-rich, 
sourced responses restricted by their role permissions.
