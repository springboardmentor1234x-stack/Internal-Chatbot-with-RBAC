However, these pressures were balanced by cost-saving measures in operational efficiency, strong gross margin performance, and strategic investment in growth areas. The company is well-positioned to continue scaling its core offerings, but focused attention on cost optimization will be essential for maintaining profitability in the coming years.\\n\\nYear-Over-Year (YoY) Analysis:\\n-------------------------------------------\\nFinSolve Technologies's revenue grew by 25% in 2024, driven largely by the global expansion of its services, especially in Asia and Europe.
